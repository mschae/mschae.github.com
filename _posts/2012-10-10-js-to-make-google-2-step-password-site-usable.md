I started using [.js](http://defunkt.io/dotjs/) and since my eyes bleed every time I have to create an application specific password on the [Google Account 2-step verification](https://www.google.com/accounts/IssuedAuthSubTokens) page I went ahead and made that page usable.

Feel free to contribute.

Thank you Twitter Bootstrap.
